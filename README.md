# Description

This code represents a simple yet engaging programming quiz application, crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the Visual Studio Code environment, ensuring cross-browser compatibility. The HTML structure establishes the layout of the quiz, featuring a title, the quiz container itself, navigation buttons, a result display area, and a section to reveal correct answers. The core quiz functionality is housed within a div with the ID "quiz-container," where questions and answer options are dynamically generated. Navigation buttons ("Prev," "Skip," "Next") provide control over the quiz flow, while the "result" div remains hidden until the quiz concludes, displaying the user's score. An "icon" element, styled to resemble a document, serves as a toggle for revealing the correct answers after the quiz is completed.

The CSS styling, applied through an external stylesheet "style1.css," enhances the visual appeal and user experience of the quiz. The body of the page is set with a light gray background and a sans-serif font, creating a clean and readable interface. The main quiz area, contained within the "website" class, is styled with a semi-transparent white background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow, giving it a distinct and focused appearance. The heading "LIZARD: PROGRAMMING QUIZ" is prominently displayed with a larger font size and a specific color, drawing attention to the quiz's purpose. Answer options are presented as clickable buttons with a dark red background and white text, providing clear visual feedback upon selection. The navigation buttons are styled with a yellow background, contrasting with the answer buttons, to differentiate their function. The "icon" element, positioned in the top right corner, is styled with a pink background and a circular shape, making it easily identifiable. The "answers-container" is initially hidden and styled to display correct answers in a readable format when toggled.

The JavaScript code, located in "script1.js," drives the dynamic behavior of the quiz. An array named quizData stores the quiz questions, answer options, and correct answer indices. Variables such as currentQuestionIndex, score, and quizCompleted manage the quiz state. The loadQuestion() function dynamically populates the "question" and "options" elements with the current question and answer options from the quizData array. The selectAnswer() function handles user selections, increments the score if the answer is correct, and advances to the next question. If the quiz is completed, it calls the showResult() function, which displays the user's score and hides the quiz container and navigation buttons. The showAnswers() function, triggered by clicking the "icon" element, reveals the correct answers in the "answers-container" if the quiz is completed. Event listeners are attached to the navigation buttons to control the quiz flow: "Prev" moves to the previous question, "Skip" advances to the next without scoring, and "Next" advances to the next question. The loadQuestion() function is called initially to start the quiz.

This quiz application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible across different browsers, thanks to its reliance on standard web technologies. The clean and intuitive interface, combined with the dynamic functionality provided by JavaScript, creates an engaging learning experience for users testing their programming knowledge. The clear separation of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic ensures maintainability and scalability, making it a robust foundation for further enhancements.
