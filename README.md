# Description
The Lizard: Programming Quiz is a web-based interactive quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed and developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), it features a well-structured layout with a quiz container displaying multiple-choice programming questions, navigation buttons for easy movement, and a result display section. The interface is styled using CSS, providing a modern look with a semi-transparent quiz box, stylish buttons, and a floating icon that reveals correct answers after quiz completion. The JavaScript code dynamically loads questions from an array (quizData), tracks user responses, updates the score, and manages question navigation. Users can skip, go back, or proceed forward, ensuring flexibility. Once all questions are answered, the final score is displayed, and users can view the correct answers. This quiz is fully compatible with all modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience. Developed in VS Code, the project benefits from code linting, debugging, and real-time preview features, making it an efficient development environment. Potential improvements include a countdown timer, local storage for score tracking, and animations for an enhanced user experience. This quiz effectively demonstrates how front-end technologies can be used to create engaging and interactive web applications.
